# Current Focus - Active Priorities

This document tracks the project's active priorities.

## Current Focus

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary: TEST MCP TOOLS
Test Model Context Protocol integration for enhanced capabilities.

**Actions**:
- Verify MCP configuration
- Test twin Claude instances communicating via MCP
- Document results

### ðŸ§  Secondary: Browser Interface for Cognitive Flow
Creating "the browser" - a web interface that enables the same voice-first cognitive flow as terminal, accessible from anywhere.

**Active Insights**:
- Core purpose is cognitive prosthetic for flow/offload/acceleration
- Voice-first, pure text proof of concept
- Browser enables rapid visual iteration
- Must maintain conceptual/verbal layer while implementation happens automatically

### ðŸ”§ Secondary: MCP-First Architecture
Making MCP servers the default choice over built-in tools.

**Active Insights**:
- MCP servers provide exponential vs linear capabilities
- Once MCP works, iteration speed increases exponentially
- Enables persistence of state for better iteration

### ðŸ§  Secondary: Persistent State vs Memory
Understanding and implementing the distinction between facts (memory) and relationship continuity (state).

**Active Insights**:
- Every Claude instance starts cold without state transfer
- Context windows lose relationship nuances
- Need state serialization beyond conversation history

### ðŸ”„ Background: Auto-versioning & Safety
Keeping work safe while maintaining flow.

**Active Insights**:
- Git auto-commit provides safety net
- Instant versioning without workflow interruption

## How Focus Evolves

1. **New Challenge Emerges** â†’ Becomes Primary Focus
2. **Solution Stabilizes** â†’ Moves to Secondary Focus  
3. **Becomes Routine** â†’ Drops to Background
4. **Fully Integrated** â†’ Removed from active focus

## Focus History

- **2025-01-18**: Started tracking with MCP-First as primary
- **[Future]**: Track focus shifts here

## Why This Matters

- Provides context for decision-making
- Shows which insights are "hot" vs "cold"
- Helps prioritize work and attention
- Creates a narrative arc for the project
