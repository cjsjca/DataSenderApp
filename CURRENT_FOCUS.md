# Current Focus - Active Priorities

This document tracks what we're actively focused on RIGHT NOW. It provides context for which insights are most relevant at this moment.

## Current Focus (2025-01-18)

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary: MCP-First Architecture
Making MCP servers the default choice over built-in tools. This is THE paradigm shift we're implementing.

**Active Insights**:
- MCP servers provide exponential vs linear capabilities
- Need wrapper/mental model shift to enforce MCP-first
- Two Claude instances communicating via MCP as proof of concept

### ðŸ§  Secondary: Persistent State vs Memory
Understanding and implementing the distinction between facts (memory) and relationship continuity (state).

**Active Insights**:
- Every Claude instance starts cold without state transfer
- Context windows lose relationship nuances
- Need state serialization beyond conversation history

### ðŸ”„ Background: Auto-versioning & Safety
Keeping work safe while maintaining flow.

**Active Insights**:
- Git auto-commit provides safety net
- Instant versioning without workflow interruption
