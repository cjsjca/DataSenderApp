# \ud83d\udd34 START HERE - CLAUDE BOOTSTRAP \ud83d\udd34

If you're Claude reading this directory after compaction or in a new session:

## STOP! READ THIS FIRST:

\u27a1\ufe0f **GO TO: CRITICAL_STATE_CAPTURE.md**

That file contains:
- What we're building
- Your current priorities  
- What to read next
- How to restore context

## Why This Matters

You've likely lost context/state. The carefully prepared bootstrap documents will restore your working knowledge faster than exploring randomly.

## Bootstrap Sequence

1. **CRITICAL_STATE_CAPTURE.md** - Your primary bootloader
2. **CURRENT_FOCUS.md** - What we're working on NOW
3. **CONSULTANT_ANALYSIS.md** - Strategic roadmap
4. **Check your todos** - They survived compaction
