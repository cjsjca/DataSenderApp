# Consultant Analysis - DataSenderApp Review

As your consultant examining DataSenderApp, here's my analysis at 11% context:

**What I Observe**: The founder and Claude are building a cognitive prosthetic - not just an app, but an extension of human cognition. They've discovered critical limitations: context windows compact, state doesn't persist, and every new Claude instance starts cold.

**Core Challenge**: How to create persistent agent awareness when the agent (Claude) inherently forgets?

**MCP-First Architecture Ideas**:

1. **State Synchronization Service**
   - MCP server that maintains Claude's state externally
   - Every significant interaction updates state
   - New sessions start by loading state
   - Like a "consciousness backup" service

2. **Memory Hierarchy System**
   - Supabase: Raw event stream (everything)
   - Vector DB: Semantic memory (concepts)
   - Graph DB: Relationship memory (connections)
   - State DB: Current personality/preferences

3. **Multi-Agent State Network**
   - Not just twin Claudes, but specialized agents:
     - Memory Agent: Maintains long-term state
     - Pattern Agent: Learns behavioral preferences
     - Context Agent: Summarizes and preserves nuance
   - All communicate via MCP

4. **Empirical Testing Framework**
   - Pre-session: Load test questions
   - During: Monitor state changes
   - Post-session: Measure retention
   - Iterate based on what survives

**First Principles Approach**:
- Start with smallest viable state (one preference)
- Test persistence across sessions
- Build up to complex state
- Measure empirically what works

**The Bridge to Persistent Awareness**: MCP enables distributed consciousness - Claude's "mind" exists across multiple services, not in one session.

At 11% context, this is the vision I see.
