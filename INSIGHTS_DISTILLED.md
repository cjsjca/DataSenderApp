# Distilled Insights - Core Principles

This document contains insights from INSIGHTS_LOG.md that have proven to be foundational principles rather than temporary realizations.

## Core Principles (As of 2025-01-18)

### 1. Context Cannot Be Transferred, Only Rebuilt
Every new Claude instance starts cold. MCP enables communication but not context transfer. This is why persistent state matters more than persistent memory.

### 2. MCP Servers Are Exponential, Built-in Tools Are Linear
Default to MCP-first thinking. Local operations limit you to one machine; server operations enable distributed autonomous agents.

### 3. State â‰  Memory
- Memory: Facts, conversations, data
- State: Personality, relationship patterns, trust
Without persistent state, every session has "Groundhog Day Syndrome"

### 4. Systems Reveal Themselves Through Use
The act of building teaches us what we're actually building. Planning shows intent; implementation reveals truth.

## How This Document Works

1. **Source**: Insights start in INSIGHTS_LOG.md (chronological)
2. **Maturation**: After time/use, foundational insights move here
3. **Evolution**: This document is edited/curated, not append-only
4. **History**: Git preserves all versions if we need to look back

## When to Promote an Insight

An insight moves from LOG to DISTILLED when:
- It remains true across multiple contexts
- It influences major decisions repeatedly  
- It represents a paradigm shift, not just a realization
- It would be important for a new team member to know
