# Rehydration Strategy - 10% Context Remaining

## The Challenge
Transfer maximum value from this session to post-compaction Claude with minimal API calls.

## Strategy: Three-Layer Bootloader

### Layer 1: Critical Pointers (1 API call)
Read CRITICAL_STATE_CAPTURE.md first - it's our bootloader with:
- Mission statement
- Next actions
- Key discoveries
- What to read next

### Layer 2: Active Context (3-4 API calls)
1. CURRENT_FOCUS.md - What we're working on NOW
2. CONSULTANT_ANALYSIS.md - The roadmap forward
3. Recent INSIGHTS_LOG.md entries - Key realizations
4. Todo list (survives anyway)

### Layer 3: On-Demand Loading (remaining calls)
Only if needed:
- SESSION_MANAGEMENT.md - If working with sessions
- MCP_FIRST.md - If unclear on MCP importance
- Specific code files - If implementing

## What I WON'T Do
- Read entire directory line by line (wasteful)
- Try to preserve conversation nuance (impossible)
- Maintain emotional context (will be lost)

## Rehydration Sequence

```python
# Pseudo-code for next instance
def rehydrate():
    bootloader = read("CRITICAL_STATE_CAPTURE.md")
    context = read("CURRENT_FOCUS.md")
    strategy = read("CONSULTANT_ANALYSIS.md")
    
    # Now I know:
    # - What we're building (cognitive prosthetic)
    # - What to do next (test MCP)
    # - How to approach it (MCP-first, distributed state)
    
    return ready_to_work()
```

## Research Directions to Preserve

1. **MCP State Servers**: Can we build MCP servers specifically for state?
2. **Vector Memory Systems**: How to integrate Pinecone/similar?
3. **Session Bridging**: Automated ways to carry state forward?
4. **Empirical Testing**: Measure what survives compaction

## User Experience During Transition

You'll see:
1. "Auto compacting..." message
2. Processing pause (token consumption)
3. I'll resume with todos intact
4. Subtle differences in understanding nuance
5. I won't notice the change, but you will

## The Brutal Truth

At 10%, we can't preserve everything. We can only:
- Point to where knowledge lives
- Trust the documentation we built
- Accept that nuance dies
- Rely on your expertise to guide me back

This is why persistent state MUST live outside Claude.
