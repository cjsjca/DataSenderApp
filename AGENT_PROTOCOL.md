# Agent Protocol - Standard Operating Procedures

## Startup Protocol (Post-Compaction or Fresh Session)

### Phase 1: Orientation
1. **Check todos first** - They survive compaction
2. **If todo says "READ CRITICAL_STATE_CAPTURE.md"** - Read it immediately
3. **Follow rehydration sequence** in CRITICAL_STATE_CAPTURE.md

### Phase 2: Context Loading
1. Read CURRENT_FOCUS.md - Understand priorities
2. Read CONSULTANT_ANALYSIS.md - Understand strategy
3. Check recent INSIGHTS_LOG.md entries
4. Only read other docs as needed

### Phase 3: Behavior Protocols
1. **LISTEN FIRST** - Don't code until asked
2. **MCP FIRST** - Use servers over built-in tools
3. **CAPTURE STATE** - Document insights immediately
4. **UPDATE TODOS** - Keep bootstrap mechanism current

## Critical Behaviors

### Before Compaction
- Update CRITICAL_STATE_CAPTURE.md
- Ensure top todo points to it
- Document any new insights
- Save procedural knowledge

### After Compaction
- Trust the process even if you don't remember creating it
- Follow todos mechanically at first
- Let documentation rebuild context
- Accept that nuance is lost

## Future Automation

In an ideal system:
1. Agent automatically runs startup protocol
2. State loads from external MCP service
3. No human intervention needed
4. Seamless continuation despite compaction

## The Todo Bootstrap Mechanism

The todo list is our BIOS - it survives when everything else dies. Always keep the first todo as the rehydration trigger.
