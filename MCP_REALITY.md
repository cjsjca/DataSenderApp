# MCP Reality Check - How MCP Actually Works in Claude Code CLI

## Executive Summary

After extensive testing and documentation review, here's the reality of MCP in Claude Code CLI:

**MCP servers ARE configured but DO NOT manifest as visible tools or slash commands in the CLI interface.**

## What MCP Is vs What We Expected

### What We Expected (Based on Docs)
- Slash commands like `/mcp__supabase__select`
- Tools appearing as `mcp__supabase__` in tool list
- Direct programmatic access to MCP operations
- `@` references to MCP resources

### What MCP Actually Is
- **Background server processes** that extend Claude's capabilities
- **Configuration-based** - you configure servers in `.mcp.json`
- **Invisible enhancement** - MCP may enable operations behind the scenes
- **NOT directly accessible** through obvious interfaces

## Evidence from Testing

### 1. No Visible MCP Tools
```
Available tools: Task, Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, Read, Edit, Write, WebFetch, TodoWrite, WebSearch
No mcp__ prefixed tools visible
```

### 2. MCP Servers Are Running
```bash
$ claude mcp list
supabase: npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest...
```

### 3. Direct API Access Works
Can query Supabase directly via REST API without any MCP involvement

### 4. Documentation Mismatch
Claude Code settings docs mention MCP configuration but don't show usage examples

## Current Understanding

### MCP Likely Works By:
1. **Enhancing existing tools** - Perhaps Read/Write can access remote resources when MCP is configured
2. **Enabling new capabilities** - Maybe certain operations only work with MCP servers running
3. **Background integration** - MCP servers might process requests invisibly

### MCP Does NOT Work By:
1. ❌ Providing new visible tools
2. ❌ Slash commands in CLI
3. ❌ Direct programmatic tool calls
4. ❌ `@` resource references

## The Fundamental Misunderstanding

The project documentation assumes MCP tools are directly accessible:
```
✅ MCP way: mcp__supabase__select from texts where content like '%data%'
```

But this appears to be **aspirational** or based on a different Claude interface (possibly web).

## Implications for This Project

### 1. MCP-First Philosophy Needs Rethinking
- Can't enforce "use MCP instead of built-in tools" if MCP tools aren't accessible
- Need to understand what MCP actually enables vs what we wish it did

### 2. Current Capabilities
- ✅ Can configure MCP servers
- ✅ Can query Supabase via REST API  
- ❌ Cannot use MCP-specific tools
- ❓ Unclear what MCP actually provides

### 3. Project Reorganization More Critical
- Documentation is based on incorrect assumptions
- Need to separate "what we wish" from "what is"
- Focus on what actually works

## Next Steps

1. **Accept Reality** - MCP doesn't work as documented for CLI
2. **Use What Works** - Direct Supabase API calls via Bash/curl
3. **Reorganize Project** - Remove false MCP promises, document reality
4. **Build on Solid Ground** - Browser interface, auto-commit, real features

## The Real Value

Despite MCP confusion, the project has real value:
- ✅ Auto-commit system works perfectly
- ✅ Supabase integration works via API
- ✅ Web interfaces provide real-time interaction
- ✅ Cognitive prosthetic concept is sound

We just need to build it on reality, not MCP mythology.
