# MCP Testing Log - Understanding How MCP Actually Works

## Test 1: Natural Language MCP Request

Testing if I can use MCP through natural language as suggested in docs.

### Attempt 1: Direct natural language
Request: "Use Supabase MCP to select recent messages from texts table"

**Result**: This is just a natural language request. I would need to use my regular tools to query Supabase, not MCP.

### Attempt 2: Checking available tools
My available tools are:
- Task
- Bash  
- Glob
- Grep
- LS
- Read
- Edit
- Write
- WebFetch
- TodoWrite
- WebSearch

**No MCP-prefixed tools visible**.

## Test 2: Understanding MCP Server Configuration

### Current MCP Configuration
```bash
$ claude mcp list
supabase: npx -y @supabase/mcp-server-supabase@latest --project-ref=xvxyzmldrqewigrrccea -e SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=sbp_f6e533073db4d535cd427967e3113c69932da4b9
```

This shows the MCP server is configured but doesn't explain how to use it.

## Test 3: Checking MCP Documentation vs Reality

### What Documentation Says:
- Use slash commands like `/mcp__supabase__select`
- Reference resources with `@supabase:database://texts`
- MCP tools are "dynamically discovered"

### What I Actually Experience:
- No slash commands available when typing `/`
- No `@` resource references work
- No MCP tools in my tool list

## Working Hypothesis

MCP in Claude Code CLI might work differently than documented:

1. **MCP servers extend backend capabilities** but not through direct tool access
2. **The benefit might be indirect** - perhaps MCP enables certain operations that wouldn't work otherwise
3. **The documentation might be for a different Claude interface** (web vs CLI)

## Next Test: Direct Supabase Query

Let me test if Supabase operations work at all, with or without "MCP":

### Direct API Test
Successfully queried Supabase directly using curl:
- Retrieved recent messages from texts table
- This works without any MCP involvement
- Just using standard REST API

## Test 4: Searching for MCP Reality in Claude Docs

Let me check more specific Claude documentation about how MCP actually manifests:
